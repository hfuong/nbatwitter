# NBA Twitter

## Objective
**Goal:** Scrape tweets from the official Twitter accounts of current NBA players to identify which other current NBA players they interact with most and whether these interactions are consistent with current/past teams.

**Questions:**  
1. Who do current NBA players interact with most?  
2. Is there a clustering of interactions within teams or among certain players?  
3. Do certain players act as an in-between or connection to other players?  


## Steps
1. Scrape tweets from current NBA players to identify mentions and tags.  
2. Produce edge lists and interaction matrices to calculate the social network position of each player.  
3. Produce social networks using Twitter interactions.  
4. Use social network metrics to identify possible trends by teams or players.
